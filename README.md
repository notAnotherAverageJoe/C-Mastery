### Introduction

C is not just another programming language; it is the cornerstone of modern computing. This repository was created with the goal of providing a comprehensive, hands-on approach to learning C by breaking down complex concepts into simple, digestible modules. Each module is filled with code examples, projects, and challenges to ensure that you can apply what you learn in real-world scenarios.

Through C Mastery, you will:

Build a strong foundation in C programming concepts.
Work on real-world projects and challenges.
Contribute and collaborate with a global community of learners.
Learn best practices and write efficient, optimized C code.
Why Learn C?
C is often referred to as the "mother of all programming languages." Despite being over four decades old, it continues to be widely used in systems programming, embedded devices, operating systems, and even game development. Mastering C will allow you to:

Understand how computers work at a low level.
Write high-performance applications.
Grasp key concepts that translate into other modern languages like C++, Java, Python, and more.
Become a better problem solver by learning how to manage memory, handle data structures, and implement algorithms from scratch.
Project Structure
This repository is divided into several sections, each focusing on different levels and concepts in C programming:

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before diving into this repository, make sure you have:

A basic understanding of programming concepts (loops, functions, etc.).
A C compiler installed on your machine (such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/notAnotherAverageJoe/C-Mastery.git
Navigate into the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd C-Mastery
Start Learning: Begin with the basics in the 00_hello_world directory, compile and run your first program:

bash
Copy code
gcc 00_hello_world/hello_world.c -o hello_world
./hello_world
You should see "Hello, World!" printed in your terminal. Congratulations, you've written your first C program!

Features
Well-Structured Modules: Each concept is neatly organized with explanations, examples, and challenges.
Real-World Projects: Tackle real-world problems, from building small utilities to working on bigger projects like a simple file manager or a mini-game.
Challenges and Quizzes: Test your knowledge with coding challenges and quizzes at the end of each section.
Community Contributions: Learn from others and share your own knowledge by contributing to this repository.
Advanced Topics: Once you've mastered the basics, explore advanced topics like dynamic memory allocation, multithreading, and algorithm optimization.
Learning Path
Hereâ€™s a recommended learning path for working through the repository:

Hello, World!: Start with the basics and set up your environment.
Variables & Data Types: Learn about different data types and how to use them.
Control Structures: Master loops, conditionals, and switches.
Functions & Modular Programming: Organize your code with functions.
Pointers & Memory Management: Dive deep into one of Câ€™s most powerful features.
Structs, Enums & File I/O: Work with user-defined data types and file handling.
Dynamic Memory: Handle memory dynamically using malloc, calloc, and realloc.
Projects & Challenges: Apply your skills in real-world projects and challenges.
Advanced Topics: Explore concurrency, networking, and optimization.
